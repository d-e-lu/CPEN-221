Q1:What are the representation invariants for the three possible representations
   of LineArt that we saw earlier?
	1)
	-List of Segments
	-Segment has x1, y1, x2, y2, where (x1, y1) is not (x2, y2)
	2)
	-List of PenCmd
	-New Command must not be the previous command (Penup, Penup doesn't make sense)
	-PenCmd must be either Penup or Pendown
	-GoToPoint has x and y component
	3)
	-List of Components
	-Components have List of Points
	-Points have x, y
Q2: What are the representation invariants of git blobs, trees and commits?
	1) blob
	-Array of bytes must be passed with not null values
	2) trees
	-contains lists of trees an blobs
	3) commits
	-contains a String, date, tree, String, commit
	-String is the name of the author
	-Date is the date added
	-tree is the Git Tree
	-String is a message
	-commit is the Git Commit
