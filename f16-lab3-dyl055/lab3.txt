Answers to questions in Lab 3

Stronger and Weaker
What is the relationship between A and B?
	1. True
	2. Weaker
	3. Weaker

What is the relationship between C and the previous two specs?
	1. Stronger
	2. Same as B, stronger than A
	3. C's specification is weaker than B but about the same as A

What about D?
	1. They require different implementations, and D requires a
	   different method of calling, such as the user required to
	   use try.
	2. All queries that satisfy C can also be used in D. 
	   All of D's solutions can not necessarily be used in C.

Discussion
How easy or difficult was it to agree on specifications for the helper methods?
	- Alright, just had to find a specification that was specific

How much did you have to revise your specifications during the discussion?
	- Considered many cases as we went along. Not much revision after
	  we completed the specifications, but we had several revisions 
	  during the specifications

Are the specifications declarative, as opposed to operational?
	- The specifications are more declarative
	
Are they designed to make sense on their own?
	- Yes, which is why we put in extra specifications for each
	  of the methods

Are they designed to make our code easier to implement, read, and debug?
	- Easier to read, debug and use because it specifies interesting 
	  boundary cases. To make this possible, implementation often 
	  requires more checking to be involved
