Our database is storing information in the filesystem. This would allow us to have relatively unlimited storage without compromising fetch speed too much. We will delete files in the folder "database" if it doesnt not meet our expectations. 
However, this means that initializing the database will take quite a bit of time. We augmented this, by allowing future instances of the database to load off created database in the filesystem. This load time is extremely quick. 
As well, this also means that sorting by a field within the data would take quite some time. We augmented this, by storing previous sort results, so future sort functions would be as quick as fetching a file.
By loading from an existing database in the filesystem, any errors would also be loaded. If, the first initialization of the database was not complete, then the subsequent initilization of the database will assume the database is complete and be incomplete as well. This can be easily fixed by deleting the previous database in the fileSystem. It should be in a file called "database" and allow a complete fresh initialization of the database.
